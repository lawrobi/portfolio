      A year later, shattered and broken, neither her family nor her friends are of any help to her.  Haunted by her demons, diminished by her physical state, she plunges unrelentingly into a state of despair until the day when, at the crossing of paths, Jade meets Zach, a 23-year-old former drug addict turned wandering recluse.  Progressively, over the course of their daily meetings, she discovers in him her rebirth into a world that previously rejected her.
