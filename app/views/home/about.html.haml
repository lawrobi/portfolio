		Hi everyone, 

		%br/
		%br/
		Some info about myself:
		%br/
		%br/
		I'm Laurent, I'm Swiss and I established and developed my own company called HeyImagine! in 2011. My main goal was/is to change the way the World operates by redirecting money from online advertising to global causes. By providing users the tool to interact with something they usually dislike (online advertising), the idea was/is to finance and solve global issues on Earth while giving the opportunity to advertisers to reach millions of consumers and sell more products in an ethical way. Using economic principles (Pareto Efficiency), social connections/interactions among web users and the power of capitalism, change is possible.
